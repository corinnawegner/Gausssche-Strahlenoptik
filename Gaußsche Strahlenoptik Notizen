Gaußsche Strahlenoptik Notizen

Einleitung:
in diesem Versuch soll das Intensitätsprofil von Gaußschen Strahlen vermessen und die Auswirkungen von optischen Elementen untersucht werden

In the first part we measured the power of the laser itself. First, we put a photodiode with internal resistance (???) after the first passive reflector and measured the voltage. We measured U=(5.59+-0.01) V. Then we turned the laser off and measured again at the same position to eliminate the background light (the windows were covered by curtains). We measured U_b = (1.2+-0.1)mV.

In this experiment we measured the intensity of the collimated laser light that is emitted by the fibre. We cut off some of the beam with a razor blade to see how much voltage is still measured by the photodiode. Thereby we obtained a profile of the beam cross section. After that we put a lens just behind the fibre end so that the beam was again in the gaussian shape. We measured the profile of the beam at different positions between the two lenses (the second lens focuses the beam into the photodiode). Near the focal point of the lens, where the waist of the gaussian beam lies, we measured three times.
